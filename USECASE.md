# Webex Spaces Monitor

## Use Case
In K-12 environments students with Webex access may be able to create spaces outside of admin view.
This container and script can be used to match student created Webex spaces then add an administrator as moderator and remove other users or delete the space entirely.

The intent is to provide ongoing monitoring of newly created spaces and move those under the control of school teachers or administrators.

The license verification function is intended to validate and, if required, update license assignments to match those specified.

The script as a whole can serve as an example of Webex Teams REST API and WebexTeamsSDK utilization as well as compliance role, Webex Integration and Webex Bots.
